EPiServer CMS UI Extension Samples
========================

This is a project that shows examples of how you can extend Episerver. These samples are valid for
both Episerver CMS and Commerce though there are no Commerce specific examples right now. The intension
is that this can be used as both educational material as well as just a starting point for extending the Episerver UI.

This project currently shows the following concepts:

* Adding properties to your models
 * Using built in attributes for content selection.
 * Building customized content selection.
 * Using AllowedTypes to narrow down possible content selection for content areas.
 * Using PropertySettings to define a stripped down text editor.
 * Using SelectOne and SelectMany attributes to configure selection properties (select and checkboxes).
 * Building a selection property for values based on an Enum.
* Adding additional views for a content item.
* Configuring the icon and behaviour for a specific content type.

Suggestion list for additional examples that could be added:

* Visitor group criteria
* Admin plug-in
* Full sample of custom content with custom view.
